# Movie Search App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## To set up the application and dependencies:

### `yarn install`

Installs dependencies neccesary to run the app.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Challenges:

I have to be honest. I don't have much experience in unit testing.\
I know the importance of it and I am willing and eager to learn.\
However, I was not able to add unit testing within 3 hour time window.

## Reasoning behind design decisions:

I chose load more button over infinite scroll.\
For this assignment, it is not relevant but if there's a footer\
Infinite scroll could prevent users from reaching the footer area.\
I often find myself in the situation and I find it very annoying.


## Future improvements:

If I had more time, I woiuld definitely add filtering and sorting functionalities.\
Also, I wanted to add scroll-to-top button because search input is at the top\
and as the list gets long, it is really frustrating to scroll to the top manually.
